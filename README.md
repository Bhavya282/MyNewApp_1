My Notes App

Overview
This is a simple and efficient Notes App built using MVVM architecture, Room Database, XML, and Kotlin. The app allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes, providing a seamless experience with a robust backend using Room Database for local storage. The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern to separate concerns and ensure maintainability.

Features
Create Notes: Add new notes with a title and description.

Edit Notes: Update the title and description of existing notes.

Delete Notes: Remove notes from the database.

View Notes: Display a list of all saved notes.

Room Database: Used for efficient local data storage.

MVVM Architecture: Separation of concerns for clean and maintainable code.

Tech Stack
Kotlin: Primary language for the app development.

MVVM Architecture: Model-View-ViewModel design pattern for code separation.

Room Database: Local database for saving and retrieving notes.

XML: For UI layout and design.

Architecture
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for clean code separation:

Model: Represents the data and logic (Room Database).

View: Represents the UI elements (XML layouts).

ViewModel: Acts as a mediator between the Model and View, handling the data and business logic.

Room Database
The app uses Room Database for local storage. The Room library allows for an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for a more robust and convenient way to interact with the database.

Entity: Represents a table in the database (Note).

DAO (Data Access Object): Defines the methods for accessing the database (NoteDao).

Database: Initializes the Room database and provides access to DAOs (AppDatabase).
